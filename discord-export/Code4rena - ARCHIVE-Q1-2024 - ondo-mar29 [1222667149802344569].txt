the contracts in this audit were included in the previous audit (of 09/23) as well?

rOUSG and rOUSG factory are very similar to rUSDY and rUSDY factory respectively, which were included in the last audit, so it may be helpful.

are the tokenized treasuries securing USDY the OUSG tokens themselves, or is USDY secured by different tokenized treasuries? (I may be reading the docs wrong apologies)


[03/29/2024 21:23] kee_in
USDY and OUSG are unrelated to each other. USDY is secured by treasuries held off chain. OUSG is backed by BUIDL, a permissioned token created by Blackrock representing treasuries held offchain

{Reactions}
👍 🥹 

[03/29/2024 21:23] kee_in
They're pretty similar 🙂 but have different legal structures. USDY has a blocklist rather than an allowlist and does not have instant mint/redemption. OUSG is restricted to addresses on Ondo's KYCRegistry allowlist contract, but offers instant mint/redemption (via the new OUSGInstantManager contract under review here)


[03/29/2024 22:20] Deleted User
a q , for exanple  ``rOUSGFactory.sol`` has only 2 functions with authorization   ``Guardian``  , what exactly are the vulnerabilities that are important for the team to know ?


[03/29/2024 22:59] cameronclifton
For permissioned functions, you can assume the guardian address is trusted (Controlled by Ondo Finance) and not malicious. I don't know of any existing vulnerabilities for this contract, but please do find if exists!


[03/29/2024 23:00] Deleted User
this is what I asked, what should we as researches  focus to find if 2/2  functions existent in that contract for example are authroized  by a trusted addr  ?


[03/29/2024 23:02] cameronclifton
We would be interested to know if there are bugs inside the logic of any permissioned functions in scope.


[03/29/2024 23:03] Deleted User
so the arguments provided in those functions is out of scope but the intended logic inside the functions has to work 100%


[03/29/2024 23:11] cameronclifton
I wouldn't generally say that arguments for permissioned functions are out of scope, if things can be broken or set in ways that cause unintended consequences it would be interesting to us. (I believe you will have to use your judgement here on what is considered an "unintended consequence" based on the context of the contract)

from the contest readme

> If OUSGInstantManager::mintRebasingOUSG(uint256) is called, they code will wrap the OUSG into rOUSG for the user as well.


[03/30/2024 15:09] sweetjimmy_
why is the wrapping of OUSG into rOUSG necessary while minting rOUSG?


[03/30/2024 15:16] sweetjimmy_
thanks a lot for this. it helped me a lot


[03/30/2024 15:26] sweetjimmy_
one of the main invariants: `OUSG & rOUSG can not be instant minted.`

under `# New Code: Introduction to OUSGInstantManager`: "This contract allows for instant mints and instant redemptions of OUSG and rOUSG."

aren't they in stark contrast from each other?


[03/30/2024 15:34] cameronclifton
Yikes.. This is a typo. I believe this was meant to say. "OUSG & rOUSG can't not be infinite minted by a non-permissioned actor"

[03/30/2024 17:11] sweetjimmy_
i didn't get this part, if rOUSG balance of a user is calculated as `shares[account] * ousgPrice` and the share of user1 is 100 and ousg price is 100.505 USD then rOUSG balance of user 1 should be 10050.5, right? (100*100.505)

Check the `balanceOf` function for confirmation. Probably when they copied it from `rUSDY` they forgot to update the example


[03/30/2024 17:33] sweetjimmy_
looks the same as explained. i guess they made a mistake in calculating the final balance in the comment. Would be nice if they confirm this

[03/30/2024 17:46] cameronclifton
The natspec is incorrect. If you had 1 share, and the OUSG price is 105 USD per OUSG, you would have a balance of 105 rOUSG tokens.

{Reactions}
👍 

[03/30/2024 17:49] sweetjimmy_
yeah.. that's more like it


[03/30/2024 18:08] thomassb1625
Yea apologies for the natspec being wrong. As you're not the first to ask about this, I'll just walk through the whole rOUSG flow here for anyone else to reference.

So let’s say `ousgPrice = 100`, and a user wraps 1 OUSG, so 1e18 (as OUSG, rOUSG, and the rOUSG price all have 18 decimals of precision).

This will correspond to `1e18 * OUSG_TO_ROUSG_SHARES_MULTIPLIER = 10_000e18 shares`.
If we view their balance of rOUSG, it will be `(shares * ousgPrice) / (1e18 * OUSG_TO_OUSG_SHARES_MULTIPLIER) = (10_000e18 * 100e18) / (1e18 * 10_000) = 100e18 rOUSG = 100 rOUSG`.

Now let’s say price increases to 105, now they will have: `(10000e18 * 105e18) / (1e18 * 10000) = 105 rOUSG`.

If a user instead deposited 4 OUSG at first, they’d now have 420 rOUSG. Or, say another user deposits 1 OUSG after the price increase, they would still receive 105 rOUSG. **1 rOUSG is essentially just $1 of OUSG**

1 rOUSG will always be worth $1 right? just like BUIDL


[03/30/2024 18:30] cameronclifton
yep!


[03/30/2024 21:49] moeid3
is `rOUSG` also follow the rules of `KYCRegistry`?


[03/30/2024 22:01] thomassb1625
Yep the KYCRegistry for OUSG and rOUSG will be the same contract


[03/30/2024 22:05] moeid3
and what is this sanctions list and why users must not be on the chainalsysis?


[03/30/2024 22:29] thomassb1625
Addresses that we aren't allowed to interact with as they've been flagged for being some sort of suspicious/malicious entity (ie hackers)


[03/31/2024 02:34] brivan
From publicly known issues:
> DDOS-ing OUSGInstantManager Rate limiter - We are aware that KYC’d investors can DDOS the instant mint/redeem contract.
Out of curiosity, how such thing could happen?


[03/31/2024 02:46] cameronclifton
If the mint and redeem limit were both set to 10m (denoted in USDC), someone could mint and redeem 10m worth of OUSG/rOUSG and then no other investors could mint or redeem.

for what is the token BUIDL? I understand in the redemption it there are not enough USDC, but why you need it?

{Reactions}
➕ 

[03/31/2024 14:40] brivan
The contract the protocol uses to invest USDC in. 
Read the `_redeem` function and you will see that the protocol redeems from BUIDL to cover the necessary redemption.
Quoting now from docs:
> Ondo Finance will be responsible for ensuring enough BUIDL is in the contract at all times to satisfy investor redemptions.


[03/31/2024 14:41] ivanfitro
ok perfect thank you!!


[03/31/2024 14:44] brivan
The protocol (`KYCRegistry` contract, out of scope btw) uses  an external contract, known as `Chainalysis`: https://etherscan.io/address/0x40c57923924b5c5c5455c48d93317139addac8fb#code

ℹ️  Wardens, the Ondo team has received many questions about token behaviours. To clarify:

- The only tokens in scope are: BUIDL, USDC, OUSG, rOUSG.
- Vulnerabilities related to these token behaviours are only considered valid if they actually exist in tokens which are used, i.e. BUIDL.

Both `rOUSG` and `OUSGInstantManager` use the oracle to retrieve the ousg price. So, yes both use the controlled oracle.

Today. Logo is already displaying on profile


[04/16/2024 06:55] auditor_79099
what is mean logo? who can explain about logo?


[04/16/2024 07:54] yotov721
On you profile page in C4 in the Helped Secure section the logo of the protocol is present before the results come out, but only (I think) if you're getting a reward

In Edit Profile you have to turn on the Display stats in profile option


[04/16/2024 08:16] tigerfrake
Also I think you have to be certified first to do it.

I didn't get mine also

[04/23/2024 19:07] codecipher9
It was sent in USDC not the bridged USDC.E, you must add its address to your wallet to see the rewards.
I already had the address setup so I noticed the payment.


[04/23/2024 19:12] 0xdemonnn
did you get yours? even in the polygon scan there were no transactions entered into my wallet


[04/23/2024 19:14] bigsam0831

will the upcoming rewards come in Usdc from now for all contests ?


[04/25/2024 16:04] kartik_giri_47538
Didn't receive my reward.


[04/25/2024 16:06] kartik_giri_47538
sorry got in another token.


[04/25/2024 18:49] thebrittfactor
Most will be USDC. Sometimes we get a sponsor here and there that choses a different token, but generally we'll default to USDC, but offer the option for the other token presented.
